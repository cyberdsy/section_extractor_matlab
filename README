GUI written in Matlab to crop tissue sections from slide scanner images.

Written by D. Matthews, Queensland Brain Institute.

Will work for bright field and fluorescence images.

Based on segmenting a low resolution version of the image and then rescaling to find the ROI in the very large slide scanner image.

This uses a file-to-file technique so that the (very large) ROI is never fully loaded into memory.
